## A little about the project and the technologies used



## A little about the project

I used PHP with the Laravel framework to help me with backend and React activities on the frontend, all components created as Function Components.

To facilitate the use of the sample application, I created a seed with 15 books where each contains 2 copies.


## Changes of scope
- I removed the rent payment amount field, as there was no rule of when to pay or the amount to be paid.

- I added the rule: user cannot keep two copies of the same book rented at the same time.
